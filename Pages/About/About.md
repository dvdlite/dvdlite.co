<h2 id="who-is-david"><a class="nounderline" href="#who-is-david">Who is David?</a></h2>
<p>Hello, my name is David Leitko (pronounced LĪT-kō).  Welcome to my <em>so-manieth</em> iteration of a website, dating back to the mid-1990’s.  Hopefully this one will stick as I’ve tried to remove as much friction from the process as possible.</p>
<p>I am happily married since 2020, and I have two grown daughters from a previous marriage.  My wife brings three grown children of her own (two daughters and a son), as well.  We welcomed our first grandchild in 2023. I grew up in the Portland, Oregon area throughout my schooling years and many years beyond.  These days I live in the northeastern United States (aka New England), but Oregon will always be “home” to me. We have – <em>checks notes</em> – six cats, ranging in age from over 14 years old down to about 4 months.</p>
<h2 id="my-interests"><a class="nounderline" href="#my-interests">My Interests</a></h2>
<p>My wife and I love to travel, both domestically and “abroad.”  We have visited Canada, Türkiye, Egypt, Barbados, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines together, and we are looking forward to more travel ahead.  We own a 26-foot RV, which we’ve taken “camping” around New England and as far as Pennsylvania.  We have big dreams about farther-away destinations in the “outdoors” and nature. We also love to kayak and visit the beach.</p>
<h2 id="maker"><a class="nounderline" href="#maker">Maker</a></h2>
<p>I have a wood shop with plenty of tools and equipment.  But I don’t have as much time as I would like to devote to the hobby.  I suspect I’m not alone here in the struggle for project time. So most of what I have made so far has been practical…  work bench, assembly table, various household repairs, storage shed, carpentry projects, and so on.  I have a huge list of projects I look forward to working on as time allows.</p>
<h2 id="technologist"><a class="nounderline" href="#technologist">Technologist</a></h2>
<p>As a youngster, I was brought up on Pong, Atari 2600, TI 99/4a, TRS-80 Model III, and Intel Sytem 310 microcomputers running Xenix. That’s right, I spent four years in the Unix world before I ever touched or owned an MS-DOS machine.  This was before Windows or Linux were a glimmer in anyone’s eye.  I’ve never been much of a gamer… I always preferred to spend my time tinkering under the hood or connecting to things like bulletin board systems and, later, UUCP via dial-up.  If all of that was gibberish to you, to summarize: I’ve been a computer geek since before Mount Saint Helens blew its top.</p>
<p>I have been a knowledge worker for my entire career, starting even before I graduated from high school.  I have spent time as a software developer, a system administrator, an enterprise remote technical support engineer, and most recently in an enterprise project/offering support role. I actually have only worked at three different organizations thus far in my career.</p>
<p>Technology-wise, my current interests lie in the Apple ecosystem, the Linux ecosystem, Open Source software, self-hosting, running a HomeLab, networking, DevOps, smart home automation, single-board computing, those types of things.  I’m sure I’m leaving things out.  I am not by any means a front-end web developer.  I am comfortable in HTML, but not so much with CSS. So don’t expect many bells and whistles here, but I hope you will enjoy my dispatches.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long-winded introduction.  I hope this gives you a sense of the sorts of topics I will be posting about here.  I certainly won’t be posting on a daily basis.  Maybe not even weekly! I hope you’ll take a few minutes explore my <a href="/archive">post archive</a> and <a href="/commonplace">commonplace</a> page.
