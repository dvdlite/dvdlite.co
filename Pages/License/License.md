<p>Contrary to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/08/18/understanding-cc-licenses-and-generative-ai/" rel="noopener">position</a> the Creative Commons organization has taken on generative AI, I believe that consumption of entire websites for the purpose of training AI models does not constitute fair use, and I <strong>do not</strong> grant permission for my content to be used in this manner.
