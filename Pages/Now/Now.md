### September 2024 - Where I'm focusing my energy

🌿 Household repairs & remodeling

🌿 Relax in the spa pool

🌿 Use lessons learned from previous PKM iterations to reboot my Obsidian vault (yet again).  Also exploring using the Johnny.Decimal system for organization of both my notes and my filesystems.

🔜 Paint my home office (soon, really!)
